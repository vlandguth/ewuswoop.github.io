Members of the EWU and Cheney community showed their support as they stood outside in the rain, cheering for their friends and family in the homecoming parade.

On Nov. 1 sororities, fraternities, EWU clubs, Cheney businesses and EWU organizations walked from the EWU surplus parking lot to the campus mall in the homecoming parade. The tennis club had people playing tennis while walking, the womenâ€™s fast pitch wore their uniforms and handed out candy and everyone in the parade waved or yelled out their school pride.
