Every year, we welcome new students into the University by asking them to Pass through the Pillars as faculty and staff cheer them on. And, every year, we celebrate our students as they graduate by sending them off beyond the pillars. All graduating seniors are invited to participate in this annual tradition of food, fun and more!
